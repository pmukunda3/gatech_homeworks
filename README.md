## CS 7637 Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence Projects; 
Build a chatbot (virtual TA) to answer questions about the class syllabus. Chatbot accepts a question from the student (autograder) and select the best response from a list of answers without using external NLP or learning libraries. Agent’s task is to map students question to a proper response, then output the response to the student. Project 1 Understanding Thematic roles and Frames, Projeect2 covers classification (eg rules based systems / decision trees), Project 3 covers Incremental concept learning / Learning by Recording..  

## CS 7646 Machine Learning for Trading
The focus of the course is on how to apply probabilistic machine learning approaches to trading decisions. It considered statistical approaches like linear regression, Q-Learning, KNN, and regression trees and how to apply them to actual stock trading situations.

- Project 1: Martingale;
Evaluate the actual betting strategy used at roulette wheel 
- Project 2: Optimize Something;
Optimize a portfolio by maximizing Sharpe Ratio
- Project 3: Assess Learners;
Implement and evaluate three learning algorithms in Python numpy: A "classic" Decision Tree learner, a Random Tree learner, and a Bootstrap Aggregating learner
- Project 4: Defeat Learners;
Generate data that works better for one learner than another. This will test understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various learners. The two learners aim are:	Decision tree learner with leaf_size = 1 and Linear Regression Learner (provided)
- Project 5: Marketsim;
Create a market simulator that accepts trading orders and keeps track of a portfolio's value over time and then assesses the performance of that portfolio.
- Project 6: Manual Strategy; 
Develop and describle Technical indicators – eg SMA, Bollinger Bands, RSI
Develop a manual trading strategy using your intuition and Technical Analysis and test it against a stock using market simulator
- Project 7: Qlearning Robot;
Implement the Q-Learning and Dyna-Q solutions to the reinforcement learning problem and apply to a navigation problem
- Project 8: Strategy Evaluation;
Formulate Trading problem into a reinforcement learning problem.  Conduct two experiments.  In First experiment show the results of strategy learner on JPM stock and contrast with manual strategy devised in Project 6 and also against the benchmark.  In Second experiment study the effect of the impact parameter on trading behaviour
